# MERN-AI-Imagen

A full-stack application that leverages the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and advanced AI models for image generation. This project allows users to create unique images from textual descriptions through an intuitive web interface.

## Overview

**MERN-AI-Imagen** combines the robustness of the MERN stack with the creativity of AI-powered image generation. The application offers a seamless experience where users can input text prompts and receive generated images, making it ideal for creative projects, design inspiration, and more.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Image Generation:** Generate unique images using state-of-the-art AI models.
- **Modern Frontend:** Responsive and dynamic user interface built with React.
- **Robust Backend:** Node.js and Express server handling API requests and integration with AI services.
- **Scalable Database:** MongoDB for storing user data, generated images, and application settings.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extendable architecture for adding new features and improvements.

## Demo

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v12 or later)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **MongoDB** (local or remote instance)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sumits234/MERN-AI-Imagen.git
cd MERN-AI-Imagen
```

### Server Setup

1. Navigate to the server directory:

   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install server dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the `server` folder with the following variables:

   ```env
   PORT=5000
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   AI_MODEL_API_KEY=your_ai_service_api_key   # If applicable
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Client Setup

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate to the client directory:

   ```bash
   cd client
